# HttpTestClient
Wrote a little test client in Godot, for testing our c++ webserver.





how to use:

click on send,  to send a single request to the given adress, file and port for example https://github.com/StrongCoding/HttpTestClient/edit/main/README.md

click on fire to make amount of *Connections* and each connection send *Request per Connection* amount of requests

for example 10 Connections with 5 requests will be 50 requests in total
